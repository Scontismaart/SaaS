# Encrypted Supabase backup and restore drill

`scripts/backup_supabase_r2.sh` creates a PostgreSQL custom-format dump over TLS, encrypts it locally with [age](https://age-encryption.org/) authenticated encryption, verifies the decrypted archive, and uploads the encrypted artifact plus SHA-256 manifest to Cloudflare R2. It never accepts `sslmode=require`: database TLS must use `verify-full`.

Install on Ubuntu 24.04: `sudo apt-get install postgresql-client age awscli coreutils`. The scripts execute fixed `/usr/bin` utilities under `/bin/bash`, rather than resolving provider or trust-check commands through caller `PATH`; run them only on managed Ubuntu hosts with those administrator-maintained binaries. Use a dedicated R2 API token scoped only to the backup bucket (read/write/list/delete); do not use an account-wide token. Inject all values with the host or CI secret manager, never a committed `.env` file.

Required backup variables: `BACKUP_PGHOST`, `BACKUP_PGPORT`, `BACKUP_PGDATABASE`, `BACKUP_PGUSER`, `BACKUP_PGPASSWORD`, `BACKUP_AGE_RECIPIENT`, `BACKUP_AGE_IDENTITY_FILE`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. `BACKUP_PGSSLROOTCERT` is optional when the system trust store cannot validate the Supabase certificate. `R2_PREFIX` defaults to `supabase-backups`; `R2_AWS_REGION` defaults to R2's `auto`.

The backup identity is needed only because the job performs a local authenticated decrypt/archive check. Store it as an owner-only (`0600`) secret; keep a separate offline recovery copy. The public age recipient is safe to distribute. Run the backup daily through a systemd timer or CI scheduler, capture stderr/exit status, and alert on any non-zero exit or on no successful backup in 26 hours. The script removes only its own generated R2 objects older than seven UTC days.

R2 is usage-metered. Its free allowance and pricing can change; budget for storage, operations, egress, and retention rather than assuming zero cost. Set a Cloudflare usage/billing alert and periodically check bucket lifecycle/usage. Seven-day retention is operational convenience, not a compliance retention policy.

## Restore drill

The drill has no production path and never reads `RESTORE_PG*`, `PRODUCTION_PG*`, `PG*`, service-file, or caller-supplied connection settings. Its only database identity is an exact target ID selected from the fixed root-managed directory `/etc/whatsapp-ai-responder/backup-drill-targets`. The parent directory and target directory must be owned by root and not group/world writable; each target file must be a root-owned, owner-only regular file, not a symlink. The path itself is canonicalized and may not be redirected.

An administrator creates one file per approved target, for example `/etc/whatsapp-ai-responder/backup-drill-targets/drill-eu1.conf` (mode `0600`, root-owned):

```ini
TARGET_ID=drill-eu1
TARGET_ENV=drill
PGHOST=db.drill-project.supabase.co
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=postgres
PGUSER=backup_drill_restore
PGPASSWORD=injected-only-into-this-root-owned-file
# Optional, root-owned mode 0600 certificate path:
# PGSSLROOTCERT=/etc/whatsapp-ai-responder/supabase-ca.pem
```

Only `development`, `test`, `staging`, and `drill` target labels are accepted. A `prod` substring rejection remains a supplemental tripwire, not authorization: the root-managed exact allowlist is the authorization boundary. Do not add production endpoints, database names, or credentials to this directory.

The runtime identity must have read access only to this non-production target configuration and no production database secret, network route, DNS override, cloud IAM role, or security-group/e-gress rule that can reach production. Use a dedicated non-production restore role, distinct projects/accounts, and network policy that denies production database endpoints. Keep the production backup and deployment roles separate from the drill host/service account.

The caller supplies the same R2 variables as backup, `BACKUP_AGE_IDENTITY_FILE` (owner-only), and an explicit `RESTORE_NON_PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION=RESTORE_<target-id>`. Example:

```bash
RESTORE_NON_PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION=RESTORE_drill-eu1 \
scripts/restore_supabase_drill.sh --target drill-eu1 \
  --artifact-key supabase-backups/supabase-20260920T010203Z-12345.dump.age
```

The drill downloads the artifact and manifest, checks their binding and SHA-256 digest, authenticates/decrypts with age, verifies the PostgreSQL archive, restores in one transaction, then requires non-empty public tables and constraints plus at least one analyzed user-table row (`RESTORE_MINIMUM_ROWS` can raise that threshold). It is destructive to the named non-production database. Do not point it at a shared staging database without a maintenance window; use an isolated drill project/database instead. This is not point-in-time recovery, does not back up Supabase Auth/Storage/configuration outside PostgreSQL, and cannot recover data newer than the latest successful dump.

## Supabase restore fidelity gate

The Phase 2 staging restore exposed a gap in logical restore fidelity: the restored project did not have Melpis's custom `trg_sync_auth_user` trigger attached to `auth.users`, and the `EXECUTE` revokes for `public.sync_auth_user_profile()` and `public.rls_auto_enable()` had reverted. The source project already had the correct objects. A successful archive restore and row-count check therefore do **not** certify that Auth provisioning and function privileges are intact.

After every logical restore into a Supabase non-production project, run the read-only gate below from an operator environment with access to that project's database and Supabase Security Advisor. Inject the URL and token through a secret manager; do not place either on the command line or in a committed `.env` file. `RESTORE_VERIFY_DATABASE_URL` must identify the exact `--project-ref` in a Supabase direct host or pooler username; the verifier rejects the main project and requires certificate-verified TLS. If the pooler's CA is not in the system trust store, set `RESTORE_VERIFY_PGSSLROOTCERT` to the trusted certificate downloaded from the target project's **Database → Settings → SSL Certificate** panel. The script fails closed if the trigger, owner, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, or ACL differs from the state specified by migrations 002, 009 and 011. It reads the complete [Security Advisor](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/v1-get-security-advisors) and fails if its results contain any finding other than the documented Free-plan `auth_leaked_password_protection` warning.

```bash
RESTORE_VERIFY_DATABASE_URL="$INJECTED_NON_PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL" \
RESTORE_VERIFY_PGSSLROOTCERT="$TRUSTED_SUPABASE_CA_FILE" \
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="$INJECTED_SUPABASE_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN" \
python scripts/verify_supabase_restore_fidelity.py --project-ref "$NON_PRODUCTION_PROJECT_REF"
```

Treat `RESTORE FIDELITY: PASS` as a required restore acceptance gate before testing sign-up or inviting users. The full Security Advisor endpoint is experimental; if Supabase changes its response, update and rerun the verifier rather than skipping it. Keep the management token off the isolated backup/restore host if it has access to other projects; run this check from a separate operator environment. The verifier performs no database DDL or DML and does not rerun migrations. If it fails, compare the target with the source project's trigger and ACL before applying a narrowly scoped repair on the non-production target.
